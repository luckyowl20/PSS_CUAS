    "### Limitations about this analysis\n",
    "Since datasheets do not contain implementation details about how many pixels are used for each frame size, it is difficult to determine how the apparent size of the drone will change with each cameras frame rate and image size intervals. I expect that some sort of cropping or binning will take effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a sensor simply crops the image, then the apparent size does not change since the same number of effective pixels are still used to represent a drone. This is equivelant to a lower FOV lens.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a sensor is using [binning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_binning), where groups of pixels on the sensor are used to represnt a single larger pixel at lower resolution, the apparent size of the drone will decrease. Sometimes this can cause the signal to noise ratio to increase. This will make it harder for us to run our algorithms on drones that take up fewer pixels, furthering the need for tighter FOV lenses. Most sensors do use this technique at lower resolutions. This analysis did not implement binning as it is hard to find information on this for each camera."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision is definitely possible for this project and quite feasible from the camera technology perspective. The budget limits of this project will definitely be a room for improvement we can show to the client if it comes down to it. We will be pushing the limits of what we can get for our money in relation to frame rates. The biggest lesson learned from this analysis is that larger pixel pitch sensors do a much bettor job at the ranges we are expecting. We are able to rely on lower resolution images to get the frame rates we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that we still need tighter FOV to get the required apparent size for robust and reliable drone tracking algorithms to work effectively. Ideally we should have an effective size of at least 15-20 px to be able to run tracking. This number is based on some preliminary research into what methods we require to be able to track. Simlalry, Kenji's report seems to lead to a similar conclusion that we need roughly 20 pixels for a 3 degree accuracy for our computer vision system to be accurate enough. The trade off of this is that we require higher frame rates for this to function as intended since the higher the FOV, the more the drone moves between frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is good news, we run into a new problem. The Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano board will likely not be able to handle running our algorithms over multiple camera data streams at these rates. 4k 50fps is almost not possible, and 1920 at 60fps leaves very little room for actually running our algorithms **and** being able to coordinate with all the other systems, networking, launcher kinematics, etc. We would likely need to upgrade our compute module in order to make this robust CV system work as we want it to. This again means another huge increase in cost for this project. The next step up in compute capacity of the Nvidia Jetson series is the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX board or the older Xavier NX board. "
